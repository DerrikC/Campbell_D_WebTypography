Web typography assignment

For this assignment I built a wireframe in photoshop and then added design elements. These elements included a custom banner image and buttons. I then created the structure of the site using html and css, and I applied different fonts using google fonts. After having built everything that follows the wireframe I added a logo, images and a banner to the site.
